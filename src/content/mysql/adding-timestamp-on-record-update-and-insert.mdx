We are going to run the alter table command and use timestamp as the data type. For the sake of simplicity, I use `created_at` and `update_at` column names. The first one is for when the record was created and the second one for when the record was last updated.

When a fresh record is inserted, both the values are going to be same as, `current_timestamp` is the time when record was inserted as well as updated. When update will run, only `update_at` value will be updated.

Adding `created_at` column.
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

Adding `update_at` column.
```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN update_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

You can create both the fields at the same time too.
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN update_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```
