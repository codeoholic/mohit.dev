1. Specific dates can be disabled using an array.
```js
disabled={[ new Date(2024, 03, 22)] }
```
Multiple dates can be also be disabled
```js
disabled={[ new Date(2024, 03, 21), new Date(2024, 03, 22)] }
```
2. Future dates can be disabled using **after** key.
\
This would disable all future dates.
```js
disabled={{ after: new Date() }}
```
3. Past dates can be disabled using **before** key.
\
This would disable days which are more than 7 days old. I am subDays can be used from [date-fns](https://www.mohit.dev/topic/date-fns).
```js
disabled={{ before: subDays( new Date(), 7 ) }}
```
