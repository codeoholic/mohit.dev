# Full Stack India
I plan to build a developers community to help undergrads learn and get the right skill set to make money.
1. Frontend - Astro, NextJS, Tailwind
2. Backend - NodeJS, PHP
3. Database - Relational and non-relational
4. Mobile - React Native

The idea is not to talk about the already known information but to build something that can be put up on a resume.

This is going to be done in my free time and would be completely free.
I have created a *[telegram](https://t.me/fullstackindia)* group for quick access. To make sure each bit of content is always available, every step will be documented over the internet.

Devs are also invited to take part in this initiative. Also, open to suggestions.
