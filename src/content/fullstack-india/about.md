# Full Stack India
I plan to build a developers community to help undergrads learn and get the right skill set to make money.
1. Frontend - Astro, NextJS, Tailwind
2. Backend - JS, NodeJS, PHP
3. Database - Relational and non-relational
4. Mobile - React Native

The idea is not to talk about the already known information but to build something that can be put up on a resume.

This is going to be done in my free time and would be completely free.
I have created a *[telegram](https://t.me/fullstackindia)* group for quick access. To make sure each bit of content is always available, every step will be documented over the internet.

Devs are also invited to take part in this initiative. Also, open to suggestions.

# Sections
## Frontend

The way I define and choose technology stack is simple.
- Building a static website - [Astro](/fullstack-india/astro).
- Building a dynamic website - [NextJS](/fullstack-india/nextjs).

In both the cases I use [Tailwind](/fullstack-india/tailwind) to design the UI.

### Deployed at

- Static website - [Cloudflare Pages](/fullstack-india/cloudlfare-pages)
- Dynamic website - [Vercel](/fullstack-india/vercel)

## Backend

This is where this gets intersting. I would recommend everybody to use Cloudflare Workers to write their backend API as it is one of the simplest and the cheapest way to get started.

Alternatively we can also talk about NodeJS Express as an alternative and build upon it as the need be.
